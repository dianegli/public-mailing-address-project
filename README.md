# public-mailing-address-project

This is a public version of a suite of code I developed for a friend's business. The code will not run on its own (propriety data was removed), but demonstrates what I developed. This code cleans raw data to output a file with the mailing addresses for the business.

I worked extensively with my friend to learn about their data pain points, and how we could use programming to help speed up their processes.
